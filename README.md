# Project : Communicate Data Findings


## Ford GoBike System Dataset Exploration

## DataSet

 In this investigation, I will to look at the bike ride usage pattern in SanFrancisco Bay Area in Feb, 2019. The main focus was on biking duration on different time and user groups. The data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in Feb,2019. The data consisted of approximately 170K rows with attributes of user's profile (age,gender,subscription status, Bike Share all program enrollment status etc) and bike ride behavior (start/end station, bike ride duration,start/end time etc).

## Summary of Findings
-  Bike usages over weekdays are greater than over weekends(almost 1/3~1/2 of weekdays).
-  When bike ride counts were plotted by hour, a bimodal curve with peaks at 8 AM and 5 PM can be shown. This shows that bike trip frequency is highest around commuting time. However, the pattern is different on weekends showing single modal curve at peak around 2 PM.
-  Most users take short trips around 10 minute and ~99% users' travel time was less than an hour.
-  Users have high density around age of 25~40
-  Almost 90% of users are subscribers, and Subscribers tends to take shorter trip than non-subscribers.
-  Almost 75% of trips were made by male users but there are no significant differences between different gender group in terms of duration or age.
-  "Bike Share for all" program enrolled users are account for 10% of totoal trips, and their average ages are ~ 5 years younger than regular users. Also program enrolled users take shorter trips than regular users on average.

## Key Insights for Presentation

During exploration stage, First, I started to look at frequency for each features only.
Then separating categorical values and quantitive values, I have started bivariate exploration and later to multi-variate exploration. For the presentation, I have focused on explaining user behaviors (trip durations, hourly/daily usage pattern). Using different user profiles, I also included differences in user behaviors by different user profile (user age, subscription status, program enrollment status).
